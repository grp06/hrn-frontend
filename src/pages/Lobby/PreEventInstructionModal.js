          Some Tips for hosting:
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>
          As a host, when you press 'start pre-event speech' you'll have a few minutes to address
          your audience.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>
          It takes a few seconds for everyone to connect to this broadcast room, so we suggest that
          you wait about 5 - 10 seconds after seeing your own video (you wont see any of your
          participants' video). This way your speech isn't cut off in the beginning.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>
          When you're ready to start the event after your speech just go ahead and press the 'start
          event button' that will be on the top left of your screen.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="h6">Enjoy the event âœ¨</Typography>
